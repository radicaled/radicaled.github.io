    This is my incredible resume for recruiters who think a short list of skills
    and years of experience aren't sufficient.

    I hope this is what you're looking for, my friends: a bombastic narrative
    that takes you through the every-day life of a software engineer.

          North Korea has finally made its move.
          An armored column of bicycle-riding corpsmen, thirty strong, approach
          the South Korean border. The fragile time of peace has come to an end.

          I was just a kid back then. A sniffly-nosed little goober who ate his
          Cheerios straight from the box. The crunchy oats were mine; I wasn't
          going to let anyone have them. Especially not some guys riding
          robosaurs all across Asia.

          You know, when I was young, we had these things called libraries.
          Repositories of mankind's greatest knowledge. Kids these days say the
          Web is the sum total of human experience. That some bits and bites and
          bobs on a computer screen are better than some dusty old tome.

          Maybe they're right.

            Once you start riding those rails, you just can't get off any time

        <h3>The Battlefield</h3>

        <p>I did a stint in the Business Intelligence unit, once.</p>
        <p>
          Our warehouse was brimming with data that demanded attention, but all
          we had to handle it was a rickety old gal called Ruby. She wasn't
          built for this kind of work, but then again who is?
        </p>
        <p>
          We made the old girl work. We had to.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hadoop finally showed up on his high-horse to show us how it was done,
          but by then I was already saying my goodbyes.

        <h3>Did I ever tell you about</h3>
        <p>The time I developed a site to help parents eavesdrops on their kids social life?</p>
        <p>Or the time I developed a web application to streamline a hospital's internal safety procedures?</p>
        <p>Or the video sharing websites?</p>
        <p>Oh, I've done it all, kid.</p>
        <p>In a world like this, everything needs something.</p>
        <p>And I'm the guy with the something.</p>
